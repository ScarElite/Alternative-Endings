## Purpose

Have you ever watched a movie that takes you on a captivating journey and keeps you invested throughout its duration only to leave you devastated because of its lackluster ending?

As a movie buff and creative write, I would like:

- I would like to know the upcoming and current movies in theaters.
- I would like to review movies and give them alternative endings!
- I want users to comment on my alternative ending and share their perspective.

## Requirements

- Use Node.js and Express.js to create RESTful API
- Use a template engine such as Handlebars.js
- Use MYSQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database
- Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data
- Have a polished UI
- Be responsive
- Be interactive (ie. accepts and respond to user input)
- Must have a folder structure that meets MVC paradigm
- Must include authentication (cooties and express-sessions)
- Must protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables
- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.)
- Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and links to deployed application)
- Include this project in our individual portfolios.
